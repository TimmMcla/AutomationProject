# Automation Prototype

## This was an experiment of running up a local automation framework to test a website's login functionality.

### This was fun. I plan on continuing to grow my knowledge of Python as well as the testing solutions within:
### I ran into some problems while trying to get this project up and running...
  1. Prior to this experiment, my knowledge of Python was extremely limited.
  2. I did not understand the intricacies that behave revoles around. I solved this one by reading the PyTest documentation. 

### I will be continuing to bring this project to a runnable state. Currently, it opens a web site successfully. Otherwise, it fails as fast as it loads.
